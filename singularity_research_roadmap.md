## ðŸ”® **The Path to Automated Research**

The sequence: **Reasoning â†’ Tool Use â†’ Multi-modal â†’ Self-Improvement â†’ AGI**

Your current GPT-2 implementation is actually a perfect starting point. The next critical step is adding sophisticated reasoning capabilities (Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts) and tool use (code execution, web search).
