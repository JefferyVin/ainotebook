## ðŸš€ **Your 6-Month Roadmap to Automated Research**

### **Month 1-2: Transform Your GPT-2 into a Reasoning Model**

**Goal**: Add o1-style "thinking before answering" capabilities

**Key Papers to Read**:
- "Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning" (Google, 2022)
- OpenAI o1 technical reports
- "Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving" (Princeton, 2023)

**Implementation**:
```python
# Add to your existing GPT-2
class ReasoningGPT(GPT):
    def generate_with_reasoning(self, prompt):
        # Step 1: Generate reasoning tokens
        reasoning = self.generate_reasoning_chain(prompt)
        # Step 2: Generate final answer based on reasoning
        answer = self.generate_final_answer(reasoning, prompt)
        return reasoning, answer
```

### **Month 3-4: Add Tool Use & Search Capabilities**

**Goal**: Implement Search-o1 style external knowledge integration

**Key Papers**:
- "Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools" (Meta, 2023)
- "ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting" (Google, 2022)
- Search-o1 paper (January 2025)

**Implementation**:
```python
# Integrate external tools
class ToolUsingGPT(ReasoningGPT):
    def solve_with_tools(self, problem):
        reasoning = self.think_step_by_step(problem)
        if self.needs_search(reasoning):
            external_info = self.web_search(problem)
            reasoning = self.update_reasoning(reasoning, external_info)
        if self.needs_code(reasoning):
            code_result = self.execute_python(reasoning)
            reasoning = self.incorporate_results(reasoning, code_result)
        return self.final_answer(reasoning)
```

### **Month 5-6: Implement Scientific Discovery Pipeline**

**Goal**: Build FunSearch-style automated discovery system

**Key Papers**:
- "FunSearch: Making new discoveries in mathematical sciences using Large Language Models" (DeepMind, 2023)
- "The AI Scientist-v2: Workshop-Level Automated Scientific Discovery" (2025)

**Implementation**:
```python
# Automated discovery system
class ScientificDiscoveryGPT(ToolUsingGPT):
    def discover_new_knowledge(self, domain):
        population = self.initialize_hypotheses(domain)
        for generation in range(max_generations):
            # Generate new hypotheses
            new_hypotheses = self.evolve_population(population)
            # Test hypotheses through experiments
            results = self.run_experiments(new_hypotheses)
            # Evaluate and select best performers
            population = self.select_best(new_hypotheses, results)
            if self.breakthrough_detected(population):
                return self.publish_discovery(population.best)
```
