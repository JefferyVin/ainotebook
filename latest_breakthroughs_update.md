## ðŸŽ¯ **Concrete Next Steps for Your GPT-2**

### **Phase 1: Convert GPT-2 to Reasoning Model (2-4 weeks)**

```python
# Add reasoning tokens to your existing GPT-2
class ReasoningGPT(GPT):
    def forward(self, idx, targets=None, reasoning_steps=True):
        if reasoning_steps:
            # Generate internal reasoning tokens
            reasoning = self.generate_reasoning(idx)
            # Then generate final answer
            return self.generate_answer(reasoning, idx)
```

### **Phase 2: Add Tool Use (4-6 weeks)**

```python
# Integrate external tools like Search-o1
class ToolAugmentedGPT(ReasoningGPT):
    def __init__(self, config, tools):
        super().__init__(config)
        self.tools = {
            'search': WebSearchTool(),
            'python': CodeExecutor(),
            'calculator': Calculator()
        }
    
    def solve_with_tools(self, problem):
        reasoning = self.think_step_by_step(problem)
        if self.needs_external_info(reasoning):
            info = self.tools['search'].query(problem)
            reasoning = self.update_reasoning(reasoning, info)
        return self.generate_solution(reasoning)
```

            experiment_code = self.design_experiment(hypothesis)
            results = self.execute_experiment(experiment_code)
            
            if self.is_novel_discovery(results):
                paper = self.write_scientific_paper(hypothesis, experiment_code, results)
